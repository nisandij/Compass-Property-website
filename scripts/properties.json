			"description":"This cozy cottage house offers a large family area convenient to the kitchen and dining areas while still maintaining an 'air' of formality. There are plenty of exterior views and numerous covered areas to retreat to and enjoy the outdoors. The master suite offers some flexibility depending on the owners' preference, view opportunities or privacy concerns. The kitchen and dining areas were located at the rear for the family who finds themselves more oriented to barbecuing and porch sitting - including a back lanai fireplace. The arrangement of the family and kitchen areas provides the ability to enjoy multiple entertaining opportunities. The master bath is bathed in natural light from high windows, and enjoys a large vanity with dual sinks and a large walk-in closet as well. The secondary bedrooms also have walk-in closets as well as direct bath access. A bonus area over the garage makes a great place to create a media room environment for the hardcore theatre room buff. It could also accommodate additional bedrooms or a guest suite.",
